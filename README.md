# price_tracking_tool

This price tracking tool helps the user to get notified when price of a specific product drops.
User has to provide the URL of the product and using that URL we would track the price and notify via E-mail.
requests,bs4 and smtplib modules are used in the making of this project.

I've just created this project for amazon and flipkart but its range can be extended according to the needs.
